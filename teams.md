### Project Q&A:
1. What are you going to build?  
A buy and sell website with auction.
2. Which APIs do you plan to use? (You can use any APIs, not just Hackathon sponsor APIs.)  
Hasura, Pilon, Netlify, more coming I think
3. What is your plan to execute this idea?  
Use Pilon to store product details, Hasura for the user credentials and chat (for the MINE!) 
Then use netlify and netlify-lambda for hosting and auth.
Problem is I do not know serverless, gatsby and webpack.
So, this project will be incomplete, 100% guarenteed T_T

The plan now is to build everything that needs to use the lambda thingy (Pilon & Hasura?)
then build the frontend part.

* Project Name: IngredoFit
### Project Q&A:
1. What are you going to build?  
We are going to build a web app that will allow users to get an idea of what makes up their meal, how much calories they are eating, nutrional value. The meals will be analyzed by Clarifai api, which will give us a list of ingredients.
2. Which APIs do you plan to use? (You can use any APIs, not just Hackathon sponsor APIs.)  
 Clarifai for identifying ingredients. Firebase storage to store images uploaded by user.
3. What is your plan to execute this idea?  
First we will get upload logic figured out, chose firebase storeage. This uploaded image url is then sent to Clarifai for processing. Next we maintained a list of common food ingredients in our source file (We were supposed to use fauna for this but our data kept on vanishing from the db). With this our MVP would be ready, but it would be ugly. The next step is to beautify it and give it our style.
